# CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY - STEP BY STEP

## Step 1: Go to GitHub
- Open: https://github.com/new
- Or login and click "+" → New repository

## Step 2: Create Repository
Fill in these fields:

- **Repository name:** `devops-project`
- **Description:** DevOps CI/CD Pipeline with Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins
- **Visibility:** Public (for resume)
- **Initialize:** DO NOT check "Add a README" (we already have files)
- **Click:** Create repository

## Step 3: You'll See This Page

After creation, GitHub will show:
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/1o26/devops-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Run in PowerShell

Your remote is already set. Just push:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\User\Desktop\Projects\DevOps project"
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 5: Done!

Your project is now on GitHub at:
```
https://github.com/1o26/devops-project
```

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, run the git push command above.
